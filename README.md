SpreadCMS.js
============

SpreadCMS.js, gives you the ability to serve and manage dynamic content without the need of a dynamic server. It, creates a context from a Google Spreadsheet and renders it with a client side template engine (currently Mustache.js). 

Inspired by Timeline.js's workflow and Tabletop.js's Google Spreadsheet access.
